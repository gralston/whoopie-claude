# Whoopie Card Game Rules Reference
*Condensed from Official Rules by Jonathan Wexler, 1966*

## Basic Setup
- **Players:** 3-10
- **Deck:** Standard 52 cards + 2 jokers (54 total)
- **Card Rank:** A (high) K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 (low). All suits equal rank.

## Game Structure

### Stanzas
A game consists of multiple stanzas. Cards dealt per stanza: 1, 2, 3... up to max, then max-1, max-2... down to 1, repeating.

### Each Stanza
1. **Deal:** Dealer gives N cards to each player, then flips top remaining card as the **Whoopie Defining Card**
2. **Bid:** Starting left of dealer, each player bids tricks they'll take. Dealer's bid must ensure total bids ≠ N (someone must fail)
3. **Play:** Player left of dealer leads first. Winner of each trick leads next.
4. **Score:** Made bid = 2 + bid. Failed bid = -1.

## Playing Rules

### Following Suit
- **Must follow the led suit if able**
- If unable to follow suit, may play any card
- When Joker is led: any card may be played (all suits count as trump for that trick)

### Winning a Trick
- Highest card in led suit wins, UNLESS trump is played
- If trump played, highest trump wins
- If equal trumps played, **first one played wins**

## Trump System

### Whoopie Defining Card
- Establishes initial trump suit AND Whoopie denomination
- Example: J of Diamonds → Diamonds are trump, all Jacks are Whoopie cards

### Whoopie Cards
- Cards matching the Whoopie denomination (e.g., all Jacks)
- **Always count as trump**, regardless of their suit
- Playing a Whoopie card **changes trump to that card's suit**
- Trump change is NOT retroactive: previously played cards keep their original trump status
- Player must say "Whoopie" when playing (penalty: -1 point if forgotten)

### Jokers
- Same denomination as Whoopie cards
- **Always trump** when played
- Player should say "Scramble" (no penalty if forgotten)

## J-Trump Condition

### Triggered When
1. A Joker is played mid-trick (not as lead), OR
2. A Joker is led, OR
3. The Whoopie Defining Card is a Joker

### J-Trump Effects
- **Joker played mid-trick:** The LED suit becomes trump for the REST of that trick (subsequent plays only - cards already played keep their original trump status). J-Trump then persists: whatever suit is led becomes trump FOR THAT TRICK until a Whoopie card is played.
- **Joker led:** ALL cards are trump for this trick. Highest card wins (first if tied).
- **Whoopie Defining Card is Joker:** The first card led (by player to dealer's left) becomes BOTH the Whoopie rank AND sets trump. If that first lead is also a Joker, the leader auto-wins the trick and their NEXT card played becomes the Whoopie card and sets trump.

### Exiting J-Trump
- Playing a Whoopie card cancels J-Trump and sets trump to that card's suit
- If another Joker is played after a Whoopie on same trick, the led suit becomes trump again for rest of that trick, and J-Trump resumes for future tricks

## Dealer Selection
- Cut cards: lowest card deals (Joker ranks above Ace for cuts/ties)

## Quick Reference: Trick Resolution Priority
1. Joker led? → All cards are trump, highest wins (first if tied)
2. Any Whoopie cards played? → They are trump, compare by rank
3. Any Jokers played? → They are trump (same rank as Whoopie denomination)
4. Any cards in current trump suit? → Highest trump wins (first if tied)
5. Otherwise → Highest card in led suit wins

## Key Principle
**A card's trump status is locked when played.** If trump changes after a card is played, that card's status does NOT change retroactively.
